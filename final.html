       Our game is called Deal or No Deal, and you start it on an animated splash screen. When you're ready, click the mouse button that says "Start Game." After that, you will be taken to the main screen, where you will need to remove six boxes by clicking on each one. A subsequent screen with a deal based on the total amount of money remaining in the boxes you haven't eliminated will appear after the six boxes are clicked. After that, you have to decide whether or not to accept the deal, at which point you will be taken to a screen that tells you how much money you lost in the first round and the game will end. Or, if you click "no deal," you'll go back to the main screen and clear out five more boxes. The game will continue in this manner until 6,5,5,4,3,2,1 are eliminated, and in between each round, a new deal of progressively higher value will be made. You have the option of accepting the offer or receiving a box in which you receive whatever is contained, regardless of its value.
