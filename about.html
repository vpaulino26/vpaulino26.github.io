        <h1>About <strong>Me</strong></h1>
        <p>
            Howdy, my name is Victor Paulino. I want to start by thanking you for touring through my website. <br>
            I was born in South Carolina, but I moved to South Kingstown, Rhode Island when I was 4 and that is where I grew up. <br>
            My hobbies include jam seshes, going to concerts, travelling, tennis, and basketball. <br>
            Currently I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
